Design isn't just for the artistically inclined—it's a critical skill for anyone creating user facing applications, including you. As developers, particularly for freelancers and those of you with front-end focuses, having some fundamental design knowledge can make your applications and pages look more professional, consistent, and user friendly.

## Consistency is Key

Consistency is the backbone of good design. It's about making sure your application appears and behaves uniformly across all its interfaces. Consistency applies for visual components like spacing and headings, but it also applies for behavior. If you enforce input validation on one form but not another, it can cause confusion for the user. Applying visuals and behaviors consistently reduces the learning curve for your users, and makes your app or site more intuitive. Here are a few tips for achieving this - 

- **Reuse Components:** No matter what library or framework you are using, re-using elements across the page can lead to a more consistent feel. Some libraries like Bootstrap or Material UI contain pre-built and customizable components, or you can make your own.
- **Style Guides:** Similar to a code style guide, having a design style guide can help keep components consistent across your application or even across your entire brand.
- **Standardized Responses:** Design is not just a visual medium - the way your applications handles things like errors should be consistent across the application. For example, if an error returns a full stacktrace for 500 errors but a "Whoopsies!" message with a dog gif for 404s, users might be confused.

## Typography for Dummies

Typography might seem like a craft for designers, but developers need to grasp the basics too. Here’s a simple guide to make typography less daunting:

- **Font Selection:** Stick with one or two fonts throughout your application. Choose fonts that are easy to read and appropriate for your audience. Sans-serif fonts are the standard for the web, but a combination of a serif and sans-serif might be right for your site. This is an area where experimentation is encouraged.
- **Fonts Have Personality:** The way a font looks can portray a feeling about a product or a brand and it's important to check what types of fonts are used in similar designs. Serious subjects should use serious looking fonts - as an obvious example - you probably wouldn't write your thesis paper in Comic-Sans.
- **Hierarchy:** Use different font sizes to establish a clear hierarchy. Larger fonts for headings and smaller fonts for body text guide the user’s eye effectively from one point to the other

## Showing Your Colors

Color is a powerful tool in design. It can convey emotions, draw attention, and make your interface more pleasant. Here are some tips to use color effectively:

- **Color Palette:** Choose a palette that reflects the tone and purpose of your application. Similar to fonts, colors are often associated with certain emotions, and it's important that you choose a color palette that portrays your product or brand in the right light. Additionally, tools like Adobe Color can help you pick shades that work well together. 
- **Contrast:** Ensure there is enough contrast between your text and background to make reading easy on the eyes - dark grey text on a light grey background might not be a pleasant experience for your users. 

## Rules Can Be Broken

While following design rules can lead to a cohesive and accessible interface, sometimes breaking the rules creatively can make your application stand out. In general, breaking rules is okay as long as you are doing with a purpose but it is important to know why you are making your design decisions. A silly font might make sense for poster for a comedy event. Some tips to keep in mind:

- **Experiment:** Try unconventional layouts, interactions, or color combinations as long as they don’t confuse your users.
- **Feedback:** Always gather user feedback on your design choices. What works in one context might not work in another.

By integrating these design fundamentals into your development process, you can create applications that are not only robust but also visually appealing and user-friendly. Remember, good design is less about decoration and more about making your users' life easier. So, keep experimenting and learning.
